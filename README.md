## **lab 3**
The leftmost cube I hhave I looked up a new material called MeshToonMaterial to make it with. I used the same parameters as the MeshPhong Material

The 2nd cube I used the Phong Material and added that in.

The 3rd cube I used the shader material to interpolate between blue and pink.

The 4th cube I found a tutorial for different fragment shaders and this one changes the color based on the positions multiplied by geometric functions.
