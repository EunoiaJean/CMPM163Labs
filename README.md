## **Lab 3**
The leftmost cube I hhave I looked up a new material called MeshToonMaterial to make it with. I used the same parameters as the MeshPhong Material

The 2nd cube I used the Phong Material and added that in.

The 3rd cube I used the shader material to interpolate between blue and pink.

The 4th cube I found a tutorial for different fragment shaders and this one changes the color based on the positions multiplied by geometric functions.

## **Lab 4**
A) Multiple the U value by 8 to get the x coordinate.

B) Multiply the V value by 8 to get the y coordinate.

C) Grey.

For the last cube I multiplied the vUv by 2. I then researched online to find this line of code:


material3.uniforms.texture1.value.wrapS = material3.uniforms.texture1.value.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;

This finished the repeating shader texture for me.

## **Lab 5**

I modified the skybox using a free asset.

I added particles to the tires.

I changed the model of the player in the gocart to Unity-chan.

I also added a hat and changed the materials of a lot of the game's assets. 

I then added more background models from free asset downloads.

The directional lighting was changed too.

## **Lab 7**
I made a mountain range by usign the Shader graph and inputting the position as input for the noise generator which then changed the vertex poisitions.

The water was made by doing the same thing but making the noise of the vertex position change through time instead of world position.
The ripples were made through distorting color with noise generators and increasing the power of the ripples. This was overlayed on top of the vertex position changes.
I added some lighting changes and other assets afetr changing the color through the shader graph to give a better desert mountain look.

## **Lab 7**

Central Park inspired me with the center area being filled with nature.![](https://i.imgur.com/kn4sNId.png)

I tried to make a central woodlands area to mirror what Central Park looks like.

## **Lab 9**

Tutorial L system: ![](https://i.imgur.com/mJVFxOq.png)

My L system: ![](https://i.imgur.com/2oBqIuk.png)

I made a L system that looks like cloud outlines. I did this by increasing both the angles and by heavily weighing the rule to be right sided.
